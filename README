Given a triangle of numbers, find the max sum that is possible from all the paths possible.

Exapmle:
   1
  9 2
 4 6 17
 
Answer: 30(1 + 2 + 17)

Solution:
There are two possible solution.

1) Follow each path possible.  For each node that has children, go down each path.
2) Work from the bottom up.  Compare the children.  Current node += max(left child, right child).  By the top node, you already have the answer.

Solution 1 will tests recursion.  Solution 2 provides efficiency.
